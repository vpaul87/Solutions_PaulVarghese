The stack template contains two methods push() and pop().

A stack of class <T> can be declared and elements of <T> type can be pushed and poped from the stack. 
Push inserts the element at the end of the stack index and pop retrives and deletes the last element from the stack.

A pop() on an empty stack will result in an exception being thrown.

The stack automatically resizes by doubling in size if it reaches capacity.
